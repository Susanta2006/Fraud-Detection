# Fraud-Detection
# ⚡ Binary Classification Model – High Accuracy Transaction Classifier
# This will help to detect and stop scams
A robust and production-ready **binary classification model** built using TensorFlow/Keras. This project demonstrates how to build a deep neural network that identifies whether a transaction is **normal** or **suspicious** with **99.85% accuracy**, even under heavy class imbalance.

> 📈 Built for financial, cybersecurity, fraud detection, and anomaly monitoring domains.

## 📌 Use Case: Transaction Classification

This model predicts whether a financial transaction is **Normal** or **Suspicious**:

- Class `0` → Normal Transaction  
- Class `1` → Suspicious Transaction

Example output:
```bash
[*] Final Verdict: Transaction is Normal.
